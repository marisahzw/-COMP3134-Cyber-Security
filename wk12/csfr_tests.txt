In the csfr.html page, the form data is submitted to the web server without including any hidden field to validate the authenticity of the submission. 
As a result of which, the security of the system is compromised to some extent, since there is no way to verify the legitemecy of the data being submitted.

In the csfr_form, it provides safer browsing experiece for users because there is a hidden field for the token that the user submits evertime user submits the form.
