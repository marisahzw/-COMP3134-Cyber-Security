**Server Port:**
A server port is a numbered endpoint in networking that allows applications to communicate. Port numbers direct data traffic to specific services on a computer.

**Server Port Range:**
Port numbers range from 0 to 65535. Well-known ports (0-1023) are reserved, registered ports (1024-49151) are for specific applications, and dynamic ports (49152-65535) are temporary.

**Bits in Port Number:**
Port numbers are typically represented as 16-bit unsigned integers, allowing for 2^16 (65,536) possible port values.
