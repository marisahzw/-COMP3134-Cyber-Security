When sanitizing user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, there are two common approaches: the strip_tags() function and the htmlentities() function. strip_tags() removes HTML and PHP tags from a string, which can be useful for preventing XSS attacks but is not always effective against all types of attacks as it only removes tags without escaping special characters. On the other hand, htmlentities() converts special characters to their HTML entity equivalents, which ensures that any special characters in user input are not interpreted as code by the browser. The main difference between these two methods is that strip_tags() removes tags and any content between them, while htmlentities() only converts special characters to their HTML entity equivalents. It is recommended to use a combination of both strip_tags() and htmlentities() when sanitizing user input to prevent all potentially malicious code from being executed, which helps to prevent XSS attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
